# Heat-Stress-Mapping-with-GEE
I get to practice heat stress mapping with GEE. Detailed GEE tutorials are found on Youtube.

# 1.Unzip the files & upload them on GEE
Download & Unzip these files (Bhutan_districts_polygon.zip & Bhutan_roads_line.zip) and upload them on GEE

# 2.Show real world count of max_hot days 
Use this file: Hot_Days_Real_World.js

# 3.Change inputs to your own country
Use the lat & long coordinates for this.

*Apologies since some of these may not be accurate

Bangladesh: [87.5, 20.5, 93, 27]

Bhutan: [88.5, 26.5, 92.5, 28.5]

Ghana: [-3.5, 5, 1.5, 11.5]

India: [68, 8, 97.5, 36] *Consider using a single state

Kenya: [33.5, -4.5, 42.5, 5.5] *Consider using a single province

Mongolia: [67.5, 41.5, 120, 52.5] *Consider using a single aimag

Nigeria: [2.5, 4, 15, 14] *Consider using a single state

Pakistan: [60.5, 23, 75, 35]

Rwanda: [29, -3, 31, -1]

South Africa: [16, -35, 33, -22] *Consider using a single province

Sri Lanka: [79.5, 5.5, 82, 10]

-Change so that it’s just 1 year and runs faster

-Use Inspector to select a point in your country to Zoom in on

# 4.Alter to match keynote speaker’s definition, average temperature >27.5॰C
